                                The file is downloadable but cannot be opened due to technical
                                issues (e.g., incompatible format).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The document has major issues, such as being unreadable or
                                containing serious formatting defects.

                                The issue is not related to missing content that was clearly
                                disclosed by the seller in the product description.

                            Since digital products are available for immediate download upon
                            purchase, Gradesworld generally does not process cancellations after a
                            transaction is completed. However, if you experience issues that qualify
                            under our refund policy, we encourage you to contact us so we can review
                            your case. In some instances, this may lead to a cancellation.
